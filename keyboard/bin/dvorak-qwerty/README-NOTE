this directory holds configuration files for xkb under /usr/share/X11/xkb/
The files inside this directory will be simlinked there once the install.sh
script has been run. In particular, this installs the necessary files to get
dvorak-qwerty working, whereby the keyboard can be configured as dvorak, but
with Cntrl+, Super+, or Alt+ keys remapped to qwerty layout.
NOTE THAT CHROME (the browser) DOES NOT RESPECT THESE KEY REBINDINGS AND RESETS
LAYOUT
