! On lenovo laptop, remap fn key to CNTL key
! unfortunately, the BIOS automatically remaps any key pressed in combination
! with the fn key to a different keycode. For example, fn+s => screenshot
! which I have no control over. So even though fn can be remapped to cntrl,
! as soon as I press any other key, the BIOS remaps it to some other keycode
! This is why fn can be remapped to cntrl, yet when I press fn+F1, it generates
! the keycode that is mapped to "Mute"
keycode 151 = Control_L
